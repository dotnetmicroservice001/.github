Hi there, dotnetmicroservices001 is a home for my dotnet projects. 

# GamePlay Economy

**A cloud-native, event-driven marketplace built with .NET 8 microservices and a React SPA**

GamePlay Economy is a study/practice on how to design, ship, and operate a **secure, resilient, and observable distributed application**.
Players browse items, make purchases, and see live order status updates.
