# GamePlayEconomy

**A cloud-native, event-driven marketplace built with .NET 8 microservices and a React SPA**

GamePlay Economy is a study/practice on how to design, ship, and operate a **secure, resilient, and observable distributed application**.
Players browse items, make purchases, and see live order status updates.

## 🧩 System Overview

- [**Identity Service**](https://github.com/dotnetmicroservice001/Play.Identity) - OAuth 2.0 (PKCE), role-aware JWTs  
- [**Catalog Service**](https://github.com/dotnetmicroservice001/Play.Catalog) — Item definitions, prices 
- [**Inventory Service**](https://github.com/dotnetmicroservice001/Play.Inventory) — Stock management, grants, availability events  
- [**Trading Service**](https://github.com/dotnetmicroservice001/Play.Trading) — Saga-based orchestration of reservations and wallet debits  
- [**Frontend (React SPA)**](https://github.com/dotnetmicroservice001/Play.Frontend) — Live status updates via SignalR
- [**Common Library**](https://github.com/dotnetmicroservices001/Play.Common) — Shared contracts, logging, telemetry, and DI setup across services (private)
